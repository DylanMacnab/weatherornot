# WEATHERORNOT
Simple practice app retrieving weather and attractions data from the APIXU and Foursquare public APIs.

## Features Ideas:
- add degrees to the temps
- add featured Today section with a more detailed version of the weather
- add more relevant details for the venues
- create a more interesting layout for the temps
- remove jQuery
- use react or vue to build UI
- add a predictive search using search.json



// Notes:

As a user I would like to be able to check the current forecast to find this information:

- Chance of Rain
- Current Temperature
- Expected high and low
- Clothing tip
- Historical weather info:
  - Record High
  - Record Low
